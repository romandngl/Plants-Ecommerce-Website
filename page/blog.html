						focusing in their daily work and study.<br><br>With internet it becomes easy to 
						communicate to people and mostly in teenager they use facebook, instagram,
						whatsapp to chat with their friends insted of going out and talking to them.
						Through these apps some people use them to spread fake news
						and information.With smart phone people stay up late just scrolling
						in social media and texting their friends.Technology sparates
						family because everybody are busy using their phones and 
						they don't even know what their parents want to say and what their children
						want to say they just stay in their own room and use their phones.People become
						less active in physical activites and game.
